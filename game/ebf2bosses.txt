Wave3 - Legion Commander
mostly unchanged but turn all abilities to lua and add following
Dueling Zone - Small AOE, buffs LC's damage and armor

Succubus - turn all abilities to lua and make corrupt dagger a dodgeable linear projectile

Wave4 - Slarks
Slark - Mostly unchanged, but add dark pact and change all abilities to lua
Bloodseeker - Change Rupture to an aoe ability, if you stand still in bloodrite you'll become afflicted by rupture; lower cd as counterpoint and change to lua

Wave5 - Lifestealer
Mostly unchanged but add some random tiny creeps and have the Lifestealer randomly burst out of them; could be any one of the creeps; uninfest would kill the thrall and deal aoe damage

Wave6 - Robots
Clockwerk - Give hookshot and power cogs
Tinker - Make homing missiles linear homing projectiles
Techies Spawner - add spawn particles

Wave7 - Slitherqueen
Slitherqueen - Spawns less units, but stronger units; while any spawn is alive will hide and reemerge in a random position once they all die, upon reemerging damages and stuns nearby units
Rest is the same
Spawned units now also have slithereen crush

Wave8 - Roshan
Mostly same, just add some warning particles for the smash and add a linkens effect to block one spell
Add a deafening blast like wave that pushes enemies back if getting damaged too much too fast
Spawn 2 small roshlings for every 15% hp lost

Wave10 - Leshrac
>50%hp mostly the same, except lighning is now point target and not unit target so the bolts are dodgeable, will bounce even on a miss
Add Pulse Nova beams passively, every 5 seconds one random hero is picked and his position will be struck 0.75/0.5s later

<50%hp
stun is recast a few times, acting as a cone
	x
   xxx
  xxxxx
 xxxxxxx
Lightning is unchanged, just lower cooldown or smth
Pulse Nova changed to a single constant beam that slowly moves towards the nearest enemy hero

Boss12 - Ogres

12a
Ogre Magi - Spawns baby ogres and grants global buffs, tries to avoid combat unless attacked; if attacked can cas fireball and ignite (ignite would work like lsa and fireball is a linear projectile)
Ogre King - Has the big AOE smash, cooldown lowered but radius also massively lowered, can buff himself to increase his armor, but can't cast stun while armored

Baby Oges - Fodder, no abilities


boss13 - Trees

Furions - Only spawns treants
Treant Protector - Can cast leech seed, globally add living armor to all allied units and can cast overgrowth
Leech seed would only deal damage if they heal
(overgrowth would be like linear projectiles that root the first person they hit)

Treants - Purely fodder
